# First-party client conformance host

This target-owned test composition runs the real public Briosa gRPC server over
deterministic fake worker and application processes. It lets the .NET, Python,
and JavaScript/TypeScript repositories exercise their supported public clients
through identical process-level lifecycle, compatibility, failure, recovery,
and cleanup scenarios.

The composition is not a SpatialAnalyzer emulator. It does not reproduce
geometry, application state, devices, or general MP behavior. It supplies only
the deterministic responses required to validate Briosa client boundaries. It
requires Windows x64 but no SpatialAnalyzer installation, SDK binary, license,
vendor documentation, or proprietary data.

The v1/scenarios.json file is handwritten test source. It is not a generated
operation manifest and is deliberately excluded from the public protocol
artifact.

Each client repository owns a thin fixture that accepts --scenario and
--contract arguments, uses only that package's public API, prints one value-free
JSON result, and exits. The package runner owns fake-process configuration and
exact cleanup so clients never recreate fake MP semantics.

The fixture report contract is deliberately small:

```json
{"schema_version":1,"contract_id":"briosa.first-party-client.v1","scenario":"default-ready","success":true}
```

The runner rejects a failed report, a mismatched scenario or contract, a fixture
timeout, termination of an externally owned fake application, and any server or
worker process left behind by the fixture. A client repository normally invokes
the packaged runner from its own test script:

```powershell
./runner/Invoke-BriosaClientConformance.ps1 `
  -FixtureCommand dotnet `
  -FixtureArguments @("path/to/Client.Conformance.dll")
```

Scenario definitions describe only portable setup and the behavior to exercise.
The fixture remains responsible for asserting its language-specific public
states, results, and exception types before it returns `success: true`.
